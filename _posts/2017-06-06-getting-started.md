I'm going to start sharing my findings on this site.  Partially as a place to document
lessons learned, and partially to be able to share those lessons learned with the community.

For now I just created a very basic template so that I could start writing.  I know the color scheme could use a little tweaking, but let me know how the dark theme is working out.

I have a few different goals for this website, which I'm going to track on the project page on GitHub _(linked below)_.

Once I get Disqus up and running on this site _(which is going to be one of the very next things that I work on)_ I would encourage everyone to communicate with me.  This is as much about the community as myself, and I want to make sure that I'm doing things the best that I possibly can.
