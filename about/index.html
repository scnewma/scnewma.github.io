        I'm Shaun, I've been a developer for almost 10 years.  I work in the industry,
        but this is the first time that I'm going to be sharing my knowledge with
        the community.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started this blog website to share all of my knowledge with everyone.  I
        am a strong believer that if you can't explain a subject to someone else
        then you don't know it well enough.  This website is a test of that for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to learn as I'm teaching.  So please feel free to share your thoughts
        with me in the comment sections on each of the posts.  For general questions,
        you can post an issue to my <a href="https://github.com/scnewma/scnewma.github.io/issues">GitHub page</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the content on this website is going to be about untilizing different
        web development technologies, but there may be some random subjects every now
        and then.
